# KiCad-3PDT-PCB-project
A 3PDT PCB for guitar pedals

Hello, this is a KiCad project for a 3PDT PCB board.
This will allow a guitar pedal with a 3PDT to be wired in true bypass.

IJ = Input Jack
IN = PCB Input
LED = LED
GND = Ground connection
OUT = PCB Output
JO = Output Jack

The wire pads have a pitch of 2.54mm (0.1") to match that of common ribbon cables.

Board width is 17.5mm, height is 20.5mm.

# If you would like to order one

Click into the 3pdt_pcb_fab_files.zip file, then download that zip file.

Then you can use a board fabricator like JLCPCB and upload that zip onto their site.

If you need the files in a different format than .zip, I've included the folder unzipped `pcb_fab_files`.
